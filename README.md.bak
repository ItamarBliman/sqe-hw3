# Assignment 3: Software Quality Engineering
This is a repository for assignment 3 of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called moodle (https://moodle.org).
Moodle is a free open-source learning management system which is used for online learning and maintaining learning in variety of educational organizations.

## Installation
First, downloading the Moodle site from here https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/
After that, we need to prepare the testing environment.
In the Cucumber testings:
For the beginning we need to create an admin user (teacher) with the username "admin" and the password "Samira321!", and a regular user (student) with the username "user1" and the password "Samira321!", the first and last name doesn't matter.
Now, we need to create a Course with the course name "course1" by the admin user. Now, the admin needs to assign "user1" to "course1" as a student.
In our first scenario, we create a Surevy activity, however - if someone wants to run the second scenario by itself, a survey named "survey1" needs to be created before.
The survey's questions type should be "Critical incidents", and the content does not matter.

$$*TODO* Write instructions on how to install the software and prepare the testing environment$$

## What we tested
We tested the Survey module that allows for creation and recieving responses by users. We chose to test the following user stories:

*User story:* A student entering a survey of a course and submitting a response.

*Preconditions:* There is a course where the student is assigned to, and there is a survey in this course that is open for recieving respons.

*Expected outcome:* A response of a survey is submitted.

*User story:* A teacher deletes a survey of a course.

*Preconditions:* There is a course where the teacher is assigned to, and there is a survey in this course.

*Expected outcome:* The survey is deleted from the course.


## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a BDD testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
